## Installation
### Virtual Machine
*This guide requires you to be on a Linux based system, if on Windows, then it is recommended to install the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL)*
*To install the WSL, simply run the command:* `wsl --install` *and follow the on-screen prompts, before restarting your system.*

1) First you will need to clone this repository before you can proceed with the installation
2) Locate the installation script in `source/install.sh` and run it from the same directory in your terminal using `./install.sh`
   - This will install QEMU, NASM and GCC
3) To verify your installation, run:
   ```shell
   qemu-system-i386 --version
   nasm -v
   gcc --version
   ```
4) Run the build script located in `source/build.sh`
5) Enjoy your emulated CouscousOS experience! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
