## Features
*CouscousOS is currently very early stages, so it will be prone to errors*

## Installation
### Virtual Machine
*This guide requires you to be on a Linux based system, if on Windows, then it is recommended to install the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" (WSL)*
*To install the WSL, simply run the command:* `wsl --install` *and follow the on-screen prompts, before restarting your system.*

1) First you will need to clone this repository before you can proceed with the installation
2) Locate the installation script in `source/install.sh` and run `chmod +x install.sh` from the same directory in your terminal, before using `./install.sh`
   - This will install QEMU, NASM and GCC
   - *(Note: if you get the error `-bash: ./install.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory`, you can run the command `sed -i 's/\r$//' install.sh`, which should fix the difference between unix and dos line endings)*
3) To verify your installation, run:
   ```shell
   qemu-system-i386 --version
   nasm -v
   gcc --version
   ```
4) Locate `source/build.sh` and run `chmod +x build.sh` then `./build.sh`
5) Enjoy your emulated CouscousOS experience! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
